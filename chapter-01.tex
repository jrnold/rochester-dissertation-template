\section{Appendix to Chapter~\ref{cha:has-app}}

Sometimes you might want a chapter-specific appendix numbered separately from
the section numbers in the main text.
This is especially useful when you are dealing with numbered equations or
theorems, and want a way to denote that a result lives in the appendix.
See the source code for this chapter for how this is done.
